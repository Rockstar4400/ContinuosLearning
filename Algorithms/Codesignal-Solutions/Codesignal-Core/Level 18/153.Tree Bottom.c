/*
You are given a recursive notation of a binary tree: each node of a tree is represented as a set of three elements:

value of the node;
left subtree;
right subtree.
So, a tree can be written as (value left_subtree right_subtree). It is guaranteed that 1 ≤ value ≤ 109. If a node doesn't exist then it is represented as an empty set: (). For example, here is a representation of a tree in the given picture:

(2 (7 (2 () ()) (6 (5 () ()) (11 () ()))) (5 () (9 (4 () ()) ())))


Your task is to obtain a list of nodes, that are the most distant from the tree root, in the order from left to right.

In the notation of a node its value and subtrees are separated by exactly one space character.

Example

For

tree = "(2 (7 (2 () ()) (6 (5 () ()) (11 () ()))) (5 () (9 (4 () ()) ())))"
the output should be
solution(tree) = [5, 11, 4].

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (c)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] string tree

Guaranteed constraints:
9 ≤ tree.length ≤ 1000.

[output] array.integer

The values of the nodes that are the most distant from the tree root.

[C] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
char * helloWorld(char * name) {
    char * answer = malloc(strlen(name) + 8);
    printf("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    strcpy(answer, "Hello, ");
    strcat(answer, name);
    return answer;
}

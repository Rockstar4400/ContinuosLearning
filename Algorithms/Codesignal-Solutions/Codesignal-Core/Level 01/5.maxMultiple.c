/*
Given a divisor and a bound, find the largest integer N such that:

N is divisible by divisor.
N is less than or equal to bound.
N is greater than 0.
It is guaranteed that such a number exists.

Example

For divisor = 3 and bound = 10, the output should be
solution(divisor, bound) = 9.

The largest integer divisible by 3 and not larger than 10 is 9.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (c)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] integer divisor

Guaranteed constraints:
2 ≤ divisor ≤ 10.

[input] integer bound

Guaranteed constraints:
5 ≤ bound ≤ 100.

[output] integer

The largest integer not greater than bound that is divisible by divisor.

[C] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
char * helloWorld(char * name) {
    char * answer = malloc(strlen(name) + 8);
    printf("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    strcpy(answer, "Hello, ");
    strcat(answer, name);
    return answer;
}

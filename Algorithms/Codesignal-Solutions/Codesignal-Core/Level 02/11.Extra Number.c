/*
You're given three integers, a, b and c. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. What is the value of the third integer?

Example

For a = 2, b = 7, and c = 2, the output should be
solution(a, b, c) = 7.

The two equal numbers are a and c. The third number (b) equals 7, which is the answer.

[C] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string

    char * answer = malloc(strlen(name) + 8);
    printf("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    strcpy(answer, "Hello, ");
    strcat(answer, name);
    return answer;

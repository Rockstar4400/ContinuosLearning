/*
You're given a substring s of some cyclic string. What's the length of the smallest possible string that can be concatenated to itself many times to obtain this cyclic string?

Example

For s = "cabca", the output should be
solution(s) = 3.

"cabca" is a substring of a cycle string "abcabcabcabc..." that can be obtained by concatenating "abc" to itself. Thus, the answer is 3.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (c)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] string s

Guaranteed constraints:
3 ≤ s.length ≤ 15.

[output] integer

[C] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
char * helloWorld(char * name) {
    char * answer = malloc(strlen(name) + 8);
    printf("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    strcpy(answer, "Hello, ");
    strcat(answer, name);
    return answer;
}

int solution(char * s) {

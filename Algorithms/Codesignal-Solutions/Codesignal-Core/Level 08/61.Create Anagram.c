/*
You are given two strings s and t of the same length, consisting of uppercase English letters. Your task is to find the minimum number of "replacement operations" needed to get some anagram of the string t from the string s. A replacement operation is performed by picking exactly one character from the string s and replacing it by some other character.

Example

For s = "AABAA" and t = "BBAAA", the output should be
solution(s, t) = 1;
For s = "OVGHK" and t = "RPGUC", the output should be
solution(s, t) = 4.
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (c)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] string s

Guaranteed constraints:
5 ≤ s.length ≤ 35.

[input] string t

Guaranteed constraints:
t.length = s.length.

[output] integer

The minimum number of replacement operations needed to get an anagram of the string t from the string s.

[C] Syntax Tips

// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
char * helloWorld(char * name) {
    char * answer = malloc(strlen(name) + 8);
    printf("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    strcpy(answer, "Hello, ");
    strcat(answer, name);
    return answer;
}

int solution(char * s, char * t) {
